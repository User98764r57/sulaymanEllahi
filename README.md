Hi there! Welcome to my repository. In this repository you can view my all of my projects, Gazetteer and Company Directory. Before I could move on to the projects I had to work on a prepatory task which showcased my ablity to retrieve APIs from GeoNames by only accessing them through user inputs. After successfully demonstrating I can call APIs from third party systems, I went on to work on my first project - Gazetteer. Gazetteer was about using map templates and functions from Leaflet as a means of getting different information from third party APIs, by using PHP routines to get information from countries all over the world. The second project I worked on, Company Directory, is a database that allows users to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) anything they wanted, unless the system deems that entry which you are trying to delete still has dependencies within it. This was done by using PHP routines that runs SQL queries to the database.
